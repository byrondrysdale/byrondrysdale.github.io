        <h3>Diego Costa</h3>
        <p>Diego Costa of Chelsea has been the player of the season thus far. He
           has started the premier league with 12 goals in just 15 games. He continues to
           prove that he should be considered one of the best strikers in the league and
           in the world. Game in and game out he is the go to guy for Antonio Conte, the
           manager of Chelsea Football Club. The way Chelsea and Costa are playing, they are real contenders for the title</p>

          <h5>Arsenal Football Club Title Winners?</h5>
          <p>Arsenal started the premier league with a loss against Liverpool. Dissapointing
            result for the Gunners but they have since cleaned up their act, disposing of
            Chelsea 3-0, and they are currently in 2nd place. Can Arsenal continue their
            good run of form and top the table to win the Premier League? Every season they come
            4th...However, with Ozil and Sanchez in the form of their lives,this could be
            their year.</p>

            <h7><b>Byron Stewart-Drysdale</b></h7>
            <p>Byron Stewart-Drysdale,College Freshman at the University at Buffalo,
            has played soccer his entire life. He grew up in a small town called
            Clifton Park with his mother and three sisters. Throughout his years in school
            he maintained a 4.0 GPA while being a student athlete. Stewart-Drysdale is unarguably
            very passionate about the game of football but knows he needs to further his education.
            That is why he is currently studying for a degree in Mechanical Engineering. He bursted onto the scene in his senior
            year during his last high school season for <a href="http://www.shenet.org/">Shenendehowa High School</a>
             with 7 goals and 2 assists; Stewart-Drysdale was one of the standout midfielders
             in Section II. With his recent success at the youth level, you can expect the top
             Premier League clubs to make an offer for the boy soon. He is being compared to a mix of
             Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. At this rate, he could go on to be one of the
             greatest players to ever grace the game</p>
