        <h3>Diego Costa</h3>
        <p>Diego Costa of Chelsea has started the premier league with 12 goals
          in just 15 games. He continues to prove that he should be considered one
          of the best strikers in the league and in the world. Game in and game out
          he is the go to guy for Antonio Conte, the manager of Chelsea Football Club.
          The way Chelsea and Costa are playing, they are real contenders for the title</p>

          <h5>1st for Arsenal Football Club?</h5>
          <p>Arsenal started the premier league with a loss against Liverpool. Dissapointing
            result for the Gunners but they jave since cleaned up their act, dispatching
            Chelsea 3-0, and they are currently in 2nd place. Can Arsenal continue their
            good run of form and top the table to win the Premier League? EVery season they come
            4th...However, with Ozil and Sanchez in the form of their lives,this could be
            their year.</p>

            <p>Byron Stewart-Drysdale,College Freshman at the University at Buffalo,
            has played soccer his entire life. He bursted onto the scene in his senior
            year during his last high school season for <a href="http://www.shenet.org/">Shenendehowa High School</a>
             With 7 goals and 2 assists, Stewart-Drysdale was one of the standout midfielders
             in Section 11. With his recent success at the youth level, you can expect the top
             Premier League clubs to make an offer for the boy soon. He is being compared to a mix of
             Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. At this rate, he couls go on to be one of the
             greatest players to ever grace the game</p>
